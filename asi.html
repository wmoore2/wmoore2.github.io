        <span class="section-heading">Introduction</span>
        <p>Alternate Solutions Limited (ASI) was founded in 1986 by Walter Schaible. The company develops and markets fluid management solutions such as fuel monitoring for vehicle fleets. During my time at ASI, I worked on software product development, including: Fixing bugs, migrating bug reports to Jira, and developing an “ROI Calculator” application for the sales group. I learned a significant amount about the software development process, and many standard industry tools.  </p>

        <span class="section-heading">About ASI Fluids</span>
        <p>ASI’s products are targeted at fluid management applications across a range of industries and users.<br/><br/>

          The Company’s main product is the Attendant 4U/ Attendant HPP. This product is a scalable fuel and fluid management system. It supports from small systems using less than 10 hoses, to large-scale, multi-site systems. The product manages fluids such as various types of fuel (Leaded, Diesel etc.), lubricants, and water. This hardware is bundled with the Winfuel Suite of software, allowing management, and tracking of transactions across all sites and operators tracked in the system.<br/><br/>
          
          The Fuel Sentry is designed for smaller-scale fluid management applications. It functions similarly to the Attendants mentioned above but is limited to a maximum of 2 hoses.<br/><br/>
          
          ASI’s Water Billing software is used by municipalities to record and keep track of water usage and the billing to go along with it more easily.<br/><br/>
          
          During my work term, I worked closely with Greg Smith, Software Developer, and Walter Schaible, CEO.<br/><br/>
          </p>

        <span class="section-heading">Goals</span>
        <p>For my work term at ASI, I focused on 3 main goals. Learning a new programming language, developing my written communication and teamwork skills.<br/><br/>

          I was successful in learning a new programming language during my work term. The company primarily used Delphi, a framework for Object Pascal, and C++ Builder. I learned how to use RAD Studio to write UI applications in both Delphi and C++ Builder. <br/><br/>
          
          Developing written communication skills was a success over the work term. Due to the position being remote, most communication was done over Microsoft Teams. I developed excellent written communication skills by using this medium every day to interact with my team members. <br/><br/>
          
          This work term was a great opportunity to work on and develop my teamwork skills. While I would have liked to improve my teamwork skills, remote working due to the pandemic made this a challenge. I was able to improve my ability to work in a self-directed fashion with infrequent supervision, however.<br/><br/>
          </p>

        <span class="section-heading">Job Description</span>
        <p>My job at ASI concentrated in 3 main activities. Bug Fixing, Replacing OneNote with Jira, and the ROI Calculator.<br/><br/>

          Fixed UI bugs, dollar signs appearing on the wrong side of the text box, provinces being listed out of alphabetical order, spacing between UI elements, inconsistent text alignment.<br/><br/>
          To fix the provinces being in the wrong order I simply sorted the list. Inconsistent text alignment was caused by two different types of text box being used. Changing the settings on the textbox was having no affect so to keep consistency we decided to change the other text boxes to match the one that was originally inconsistent. Skills I developed include Problem solving and Critical thinking. Some tools I used include:  Jira, Delphi/Object Pascal, MSSQL, and VMWare. The software was written in Delphi, utilizing MSSQL for database management. VMWare virtualization was extremely important for isolation bugs and properly diagnosing the cause.<br/><br/>
          
          Replaced OneNote with Jira for the bug tracking tool being used. Including setting up the Jira instance using materials from Atlassian as well as transferring all bugs logged in OneNote to Jira and assigning priority levels to each one. Tools I used include Linux server, Jira server, OneNote, and VMWare. The Jira server is being hosted on a Linux server, which is accessed using a VPN alongside VMWare.<br/><br/>
          
          
          Tasked with creating an application for the sales team, essentially turning a spreadsheet into a “living document” that could be edited in front of the customer and produce a pdf outlining the savings that could be had if they purchased the product. I learned more about the requirements gathering process and creating a requirements document. I applied knowledge from CIS 2170 UI Design when wireframing and iterating on the UI. I expanded on the UI/controller design philosophy presented in CIS2430 OOP by learning about the MVVM philosophy.<br/><br/>
          </p>

        <span class="section-heading">Conclusions</span>
        <p>During my work term at ASI, I developed my skills, communication, and ability to work in a self-directed manner, Delphi/Object Pascal, VMWare virtualization, Jira, C++ Builder and Balsamiq. I also contributed to the company by creating the ROI Calculator for the sales group, fixing bugs on Winfuel v2.0, and setting up Jira to track bugs and issues more efficiently. Overall, I found my time at ASI to be a valuable learning experience and a very worthwhile work term.</p><br/>
